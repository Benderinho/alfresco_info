The documentation from Alfresco about configuring Kerberos authentication is actually pretty good, except for two things:
https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/tasks/kerberos-AD-config.html

* you need to install kerberos packages, if you are running Alfresco on Linux.
** On Ubuntu I needed to install the package (apt install) krb5-user
** when you copied the keytabs to your Alfresco Server, you can check if it is working with commands like
*** klist -t -k /path/to/your/keytab
*** kinit -V -k -t /path/to/your/keytab HTTP/host.domain
*** klist -e

* at some point in the configuration files, they mix HTTP in capital letters and http in lower case letters - just stay with one possibility all the time and replace whenever they deriaviate from your choice.
